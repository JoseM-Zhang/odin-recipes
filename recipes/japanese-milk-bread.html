        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Milk bread is an incredibly soft, fluffy, light white bread made with milk that's perfect for toast,
            sandwiches, or simple enjoying by itself. It goes by many names and is also known as Japanese milk bread, shokupan, Korean milk bread (우유식빵),
            Chinese milk bread, or Hokkaido milk bread.</p>

        <p>Japanese milk bread is also called 'shokupan' in Japan, which is translates to 'eating bread' because it can be eaten every day as a simple, white bread.
            Hokkaido milk bread is made from milk from Hokkaido, which is known for their high quality milk and dairy products.</p>

        <p>They're sold in most Asian bakeries such as 85° Bakery, Tous Les Jours, and Paris Baguette.
            They can be baked in open loaf pans to reveal a golden, brown crust or baked in pullman loaf pans for a rectangular shape that's great for sandwiches. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Bread flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Active dry yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Shape and form the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal parts and form into a ball.
                Let it rest for 15 minutes loosely covered.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into an oval shape.
                Flip it over so the surface (crust) is on the bottom. </li>
            <li>Letter fold: Fold the top and bottom third over the center.</li>
            <li>Rotate 90° and roll it up to form a spiral while pressing down.</li>
            <li>Pinch the seam closed and add three pieces seam side down into a loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Proof in a warm, humid place until it doubles in size or it's 1cm below the rim of the loaf pan.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bake and enjoy!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bake at 356° for 25 minutes or until there's a golden brown crust.</li>
            <li>Immediately apply a thin layer of egg wash.
                To do this, crack an egg in a small bowl and mix together.
                Using a pastry brush, brush on a thin layer of the egg mixture.
                The heat from the bread will cook the egg, giving you a shiny golden crust.</li>
            <li>Remove the loaves from the pan and allow to cool on a cooling rack. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
