        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Congee, also known as rice porridge or jook, is a classic Chinese comfort food that can easily be made at home.
            It is a humbling dish that was commonly served in feudal China when grains and food were scarce.
            With just rice, water, and salt, this delicious rice porridge was made to stretch for days.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, congee has become a common breakfast staple.
            It is the ultimate Chinese comfort food, especially when served hot during the cold and flu season,
            but it’s a soothing meal any time of day regardless of how you’re feeling.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely minced ginger </li>
            <li>3 green onions, whites chopped and greens thinly sliced lengthwise, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chicken bouillon </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper </li>
            <li>1 cup jasmine rice </li>
            <li>10 cups low-sodium chicken stock </li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and sliced into thin matchsticks, to garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the sliced chicken breast, minced ginger, chopped whites from the green onions,
                chicken bouillon, and white pepper in a medium bowl and stir to combine.
                Cover and refrigerate until the congee is ready.</li>
            <li>Wash and rinse the rice with cold water until the water is clear. Strain the rice.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock to a large pot over high heat and bring to a rippling boil.
                Lower the heat to medium and add the rice. Give the rice a gentle swirl to distribute it in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Place the lid slightly ajar and adjust the heat to maintain a low simmer.
                Cook, without stirring, until the outlines of the grains of rice are no longer visible, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and give the congee a gentle mix. You can add additional stock or water for a looser consistency, to your liking.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoned chicken and submerged it into the congee.
                Stir and break up the chicken slices. Cook over medium heat or until the chicken is no longer pink,
                10 to 15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the chicken from sticking to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste. Add the chicken congee to a bowl or individual bowls and garnish with thinly sliced ginger and scallion greens. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
