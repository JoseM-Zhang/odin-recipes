        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have always loved fried rice. I could probably eat an entire bowl.
            The great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever you would like!
            I have added bacon, chicken, and ham. It is the perfect fried rice base and they say the secret ingredient to get the authentic Chinese taste is sesame oil.
            Whatever it may be it is fantastic!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
